#### BACKEND

The Directory javainuse/src/main/resources contains the application.properties config file for the backend. This includes the following configurations 
The port on which the server needs to be started 
> server.port=8080

#### Database connection credentials
`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/reddb?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&autoReconnect=true&useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=yourDatabaseUsername
spring.datasource.password=yourDatabasePassword
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
