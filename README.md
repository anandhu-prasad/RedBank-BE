Import the >[db_dump.sql] file to create the databases tables required for the first run.  

###### BACKEND

The Directory javainuse/src/main/resources contains the application.properties config file for the backend. This includes the following configurations 
The port on which the server needs to be started 
> server.port=8080

###### Database connection credentials
`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/reddb?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&autoReconnect=true&useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=yourDatabaseUsername
spring.datasource.password=yourDatabasePassword
